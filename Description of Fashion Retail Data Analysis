This project involved the comprehensive analysis of a fashion retail dataset using a snowflake schema. 
The dataset, specifically designed for this project, encompassed various aspects of the retail business, including sales, inventory, and customer data. 
Leveraging Power BI, I implemented a robust data ecosystem to analyze sales trends, customer behavior, and inventory management metrics. 
The analysis yielded actionable insights and recommendations to optimize product offerings, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance operational efficiency within the fashion retail industry.
