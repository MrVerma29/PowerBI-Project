# Power BI Projects Description

# Fashion Retail Data Analysis
Description: 
This project involved the comprehensive analysis of a fashion retail dataset using a snowflake schema. 
The dataset, specifically designed for this project, encompassed various aspects of the retail business, including sales, inventory, and customer data. 
Leveraging Power BI, I implemented a robust data ecosystem to analyze sales trends, customer behavior, and inventory management metrics. 
The analysis yielded actionable insights and recommendations to optimize product offerings, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance operational efficiency within the fashion retail industry.


# Sales Data Transformation and Analysis
Description: In this project, I tackled the challenge of restructuring and cleansing unstructured sales data to extract valuable insights. 
The dataset, comprising sales transactions from a multinational corporation operating across continents, presented significant data quality issues and inconsistencies. 
Employing over 20+ DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) queries in Power BI, I meticulously refined the data, standardized formats, and corrected discrepancies to transform raw data into a reliable source of information. 
The resulting insights facilitated data-driven decision-making, enabling strategic planning and performance optimization within the sales domain.
